Pantry: your grocery managing app, built for Hack the North 2022.

## What it does
Pantry is an all-in-one solution for managing the items in your pantry, from 
buying to eating. Pantry will ensure you never have to ask yourself, *Do we have
milk at home? How old is our bread? Do we have enough pasta? Do we even have enough money?*
Pantry provides a simple interface for making grocery lists, managing pantry
items, and tracking grocery spending habits. It will help you cut down on food waste

## How it's built
Pantry is built using Python and Flask for the backend and vanilla HTML and CSS with bootstrap and jQuery for the frontend. 

## How to run it
1. Install the `requirements.txt` packages.
2. Change into the src directory.
3. Run `flask --app pantry-app init-db`.
4. Run `flask --app pantry-app run`.

## Inspiration
I have a problem with managing expired foods. Many times over, I have disappointedly pulled jars 
from my pantry that turned out to be *a few years* too old or grabbed cheese that was a *little bit* 
greener than it should be. It haunts my dreams. So, I decided to build a solution: an app that can
track my food for me. 

## What was learned
This is my first time making a complete web application from scratch. I learned how to store user data, 
design the front end, and create a cohesive user experience.
